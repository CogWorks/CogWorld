Threaded Cognition
ACT-R Implementation
Dario Salvucci & Niels Taatgen

This file contains the code that implements the threaded cognition theory of concurrent multitasking.  To install the code into your ACT-R setup, place the file “threads.lisp” into the directory “actr6/modules/”.  The code will compile and load automatically during the next startup of the ACT-R system.  The provided sample model can then be loaded and run.  All code and models have been tested on a Macintosh running OS 10.4.9 and MCL 5.1 with ACT-R version 1.1 [r222].

For more information on using threading in your own models, please see the user guide "threads.pdf" in this directory.
