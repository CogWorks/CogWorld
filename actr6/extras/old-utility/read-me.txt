This directory contains a module that implments the previous
utility equation (PG-C) for productions and the corresponding
tutorial units.


To use the old mechanism instead of the new one, remove the 
utility-and-reward-1.lisp file from the modules directory 
and replace it with the utility-and-reward.lisp file found here.
